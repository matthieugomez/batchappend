## description


The command `capappend`  handles variables with conflicting types by converting them to string. The issue with the base command `append` is that variables with conflicting types are converted to  missing values.

## installation

```
net install capappend , from(https://github.com/matthieugomez/stata-capappend/raw/master/)
```
